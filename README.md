Okay, no bother at all\! I'm happy to help you put together a README file for your project. A good README is essential for any project, making it easy for others (and your future self\!) to understand, set up, and use your application.

Based on our discussions and the code snippets you've shared, here's a comprehensive README file for your "Store Rating App":

# Store Rating Application

A full-stack web application for managing stores, allowing users to rate them, and providing distinct dashboards for different user roles (Normal User, Store Owner, System Administrator).



## 1\. Project Description

This is a web application designed to allow users to discover, browse, and rate various stores. It features a robust user authentication and authorization system that categorizes users into three distinct roles:

  * **Normal User:** Can view and search for stores, submit ratings, and manage their own profile.
  * **Store Owner:** Can view details and ratings for the stores they own.
  * **System Administrator:** Has full control over all users, stores, and can view overall system statistics.

The application is built with a Node.js (Express) backend and a React.js frontend, utilizing SQLite as its database.

## 2\. Features

**General:**

  * User Registration & Login
  * JWT-based Authentication & Authorization
  * Role-based access control
  * Responsive UI

**Normal User Features:**

  * Browse and search for stores.
  * View store details, including average ratings.
  * Submit new ratings for stores.
  * Update their own submitted ratings.
  * Update profile (e.g., password).

**Store Owner Features:**

  * Dedicated dashboard.
  * View a list of stores they are assigned to.
  * See individual ratings submitted for their stores.
  * View average ratings for their stores.
  * Update profile (e.g., password).

**System Administrator Features:**

  * Dedicated dashboard.
  * Manage (Add, Update, Delete) users.
  * Manage (Add, Update, Delete) stores.
  * Assign store owners to specific stores.
  * View overall system metrics and user activities.

## 3\. Tech Stack

**Backend:**

  * **Node.js:** JavaScript runtime
  * **Express.js:** Web framework for Node.js
  * **SQLite3:** Lightweight, file-based SQL database
  * **jsonwebtoken (JWT):** For user authentication
  * **bcrypt.js:** For password hashing
  * **dotenv:** For environment variable management
  * **cors:** For Cross-Origin Resource Sharing

**Frontend:**

  * **React.js:** JavaScript library for building user interfaces
  * **React Router DOM:** For navigation and routing
  * **Axios:** Promise-based HTTP client for API requests
  * **jwt-decode:** To decode JWTs on the client side
  * **Context API / `useContext`:** For global state management (e.g., AuthContext)

## 4\. Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

  * **Node.js** (LTS version recommended, e.g., v18.x or v20.x)
  * **npm** (Node Package Manager, usually comes with Node.js) or **yarn**

## 5\. Getting Started

Follow these steps to get your development environment up and running.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd StoreRatingApp
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the `project--backend` directory and install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    cd project--backend
    npm install # or yarn install
    ```

3.  **Create a `.env` file in the `project--backend` directory** and add your environment variables:

    ```
    PORT=5000
    JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_jwt_key_here
    DATABASE_URL=./data/store_rating_app.db
    ```

      * **`JWT_SECRET`**: Choose a strong, unique secret key.
      * **`DATABASE_URL`**: Path to your SQLite database file.

4.  **Navigate back to the root and then into the `project---frontend` directory and install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    cd ../project---frontend
    npm install # or yarn install
    ```

5.  **Create a `.env` file in the `project---frontend` directory** and add your environment variables:

    ```
    REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
    ```

      * Ensure the `REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL` matches your backend server's address and port.

### Running the Application

1.  **Start the Backend Server:**
    Open a terminal, navigate to `project--backend`, and run:

    ```bash
    npm start # or yarn start
    ```

    The backend server should start on `http://localhost:5000` (or your specified PORT). You should see messages like "Auth routes loaded", "Store routes loaded", etc., and "Database connected.".

2.  **Start the Frontend Development Server:**
    Open a **new terminal**, navigate to `project---frontend`, and run:

    ```bash
    npm start # or yarn start
    ```

    This will open the application in your default browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## 6\. Usage

Upon launching the application, you'll be presented with a home page that allows you to choose your role for login or registration.

### User Roles

The application supports three distinct user roles:

  * **Normal User:** For general users who want to rate stores.
  * **Store Owner:** For individuals who own one or more stores and want to manage/view their specific store's ratings.
  * **System Administrator:** For application administrators with full control over user and store data.

### Default Credentials (for testing)

You might need to register users first or insert some directly into your SQLite database for initial testing. Here's how you might create a few for development:

**System Administrator:**

  * **Email:** `admin@example.com`
  * **Password:** `admin123`
  * **Role:** `System Administrator`

**Store Owner:**

  * **Email:** `owner@example.com`
  * **Password:** `owner123`
  * **Role:** `Store Owner`
  * *(Remember to assign a store to this owner in the database or via admin panel)*

**Normal User:**

  * **Email:** `user@example.com`
  * **Password:** `user123`
  * **Role:** `Normal User`

*(Note: You will likely need to register these users via the frontend registration forms or manually insert them into your `users` table in the SQLite database (`store_rating_app.db`) if registration forms are not yet fully implemented for all roles.)*

## 8\. API Endpoints (Key Examples)

The backend provides a RESTful API. Below are some of the key endpoints:

**Authentication & Users (`/api/auth`, `/api/users`):**

  * `POST /api/auth/register` - Register a new user
  * `POST /api/auth/login` - User login, returns JWT
  * `GET /api/users/profile` - Get authenticated user's profile (protected)
  * `PUT /api/users/profile` - Update authenticated user's profile (protected)

**Stores (`/api/stores`):**

  * `GET /api/stores` - Get all public stores (with search, pagination)
  * `GET /api/stores/search` - (If still used by frontend) Get all public stores
  * `GET /api/stores/:id` - Get a single store by ID
  * `POST /api/stores` - Add a new store (Admin protected)
  * `PUT /api/stores/:id` - Update store details (Admin protected)
  * `DELETE /api/stores/:id` - Delete a store (Admin protected)

**Store Owner Specific (`/api/owner`):**

  * `GET /api/owner/stores` - Get stores owned by the authenticated owner (Owner protected)
  * `GET /api/owner/ratings` - Get ratings for stores owned by the authenticated owner (Owner protected)
